#This routine applies the periodic boundary conditions on 2-D lattice
#It takes the lattice point (j,k) and determines nnl (nearest neighbour left) and nnr (nearest neighbour right) on each direction.
#If the point (j,k) is at the boundary the nnl_x,y and nnr_x,y are set accordingly.
#Then it returns nnl_x,y and nnr_x,y.
